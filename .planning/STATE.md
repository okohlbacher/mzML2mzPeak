# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-03)

**Core value:** Convert an arbitrary imzML imaging dataset into a valid imaging mzPeak file without losing spatial or spectral information — every pixel's coordinates and its m/z + intensity data survive the roundtrip.
**Current focus:** Phase 0 — Environment & Foundations

## Current Position

Phase: 0 of 7 (Environment & Foundations)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-06-03 — Roadmap created (7 horizontal-layer phases, 30/30 requirements mapped)

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Horizontal-layer build (env → spike → read → schema → write → verify → CLI), not vertical slices.
- Roadmap: Coordinate-exposure spike (Phase 1) is a blocking gate before any layer is built.
- Roadmap: Imaging schema implemented against `docs/imaging-mzpeak-spec-draft.md` v0.3 (Int64 scan-facet coord columns, run-level `ms_run.parameters`, fixed top-left orientation, L1/L2 tolerance levels).
- Roadmap: PXD001283 full 34,840-spectrum conversion (DAT-01) is the final integration/acceptance gate in Phase 6.
- Process: Adversarial CODEX/CLI review runs at the START and END of every phase (hard requirement).

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Pitfall #1: `mzpeak_prototyping` pins `mzdata` WITHOUT the `imzml` feature; workspace must reconcile to a single `mzdata` copy with `features=["imzml"]` (validated in Phase 0/1).
- The PXD001283 `.ibd` binary is missing locally and must be fetched + UUID-verified in Phase 0 before any read path runs.
- Continuous-mode m/z materialization behavior and run-level scanSettings retention (`IMS:1000046/47`) are unresolved until Phases 1/3.
